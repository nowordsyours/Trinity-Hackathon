## ❗ Problem Statement: The Sanitation Paradox (2025) 

India has successfully built toilets, but **people still don't trust them**. 

- ✅ **95%+ villages are ODF Plus certified** 
- ❌ **Only 10% of users trust public toilet maintenance** 
- 🚫 **68% of people avoid public toilets entirely** 
- 🧠 Root cause: **Psychological Scarring** due to bad odor, dirty floors, no water, and unsafe environments 

**Result:** Infrastructure exists, but usage does not.

--- 

## 💡 Our Solution 

We convert a public toilet into a **"Living Smart Unit"** that: 

- Detects hygiene issues **before users arrive** 
- Automatically responds using **IoT-driven actions** 
- Displays a **real-time Hygiene Trust Score** outside the toilet 
- Rebuilds confidence through **pre-entry validation**
