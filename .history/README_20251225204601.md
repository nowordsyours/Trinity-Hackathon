# 🧼 The IoT Hygiene Ecosystem  
### Transforming Public Sanitation through Real-Time Monitoring & Digital Trust 

--- 

## 🚀 Hackathon Project Overview 

**The IoT Hygiene Ecosystem** is a smart sanitation solution designed to restore **public trust in toilets** using **IoT sensors, real-time hygiene scoring, and automated sanitation actions**.  
The project targets **urban, rural, and institutional public toilets** under India's **Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)** framework. 

📅 **Target Deployment:** July 2025  
🎯 **Theme:** Smart Cities | IoT | AI | Public Health | Digital India

## ❗ Problem Statement: The Sanitation Paradox (2025) 

India has successfully built toilets, but **people still don't trust them**. 

- ✅ **95%+ villages are ODF Plus certified** 
- ❌ **Only 10% of users trust public toilet maintenance** 
- 🚫 **68% of people avoid public toilets entirely** 
- 🧠 Root cause: **Psychological Scarring** due to bad odor, dirty floors, no water, and unsafe environments 

**Result:** Infrastructure exists, but usage does not.

--- 

## 💡 Our Solution 

We convert a public toilet into a **"Living Smart Unit"** that: 

- Detects hygiene issues **before users arrive** 
- Automatically responds using **IoT-driven actions** 
- Displays a **real-time Hygiene Trust Score** outside the toilet 
- Rebuilds confidence through **pre-entry validation**

## 🔍 Key Features 

### 🧪 Real-Time Hygiene Monitoring 
- Ammonia & odor detection 
- Water and soap level tracking 
- Touchless usage detection 

### 📊 Digital Trust Score 
- Live hygiene score display 
- Last cleaned / disinfected time 
- QR-based hygiene verification for users & tourists 

### 🤖 Automated Sanitation 
- Auto exhaust & odor neutralization 
- UV-C sterilization after usage 
- Touchless flush and taps 

### 🚨 Safety & Inclusion 
- Panic/help button 
- Slip detection (future scope) 
- Women & elderly-friendly design 

--- 

## 🧠 Behavioral Research (User-Centric Design) 

We conducted a **10-point questionnaire** to identify real user pain points: 

- Fear of bad smell & dirty floors 
- Avoidance of water intake 
- Surface-touch anxiety 
- Willingness to pay for guaranteed hygiene 
- Trust in digital hygiene scores 

📌 Insight: **Smell and first impression decide usage within 3 seconds**
